# Why Rust?

While Rust doesn't aim at being a scientific language, its focus on being a general purpose language allows a phenomenon similar to what happened with Python, where people from many areas pushed the language in different directions (system scripting, web development, numerical programming...) creating an environment where developers can combine it all in their systems.

Rust brings many best practices to the default experience: integrated package management with Cargo (supporting documentation, testing and benchmarking). Some of them are not viable in C/C++ due to the widespread adoption of both languages and backward compatibility guarantees, but due to Rust being developed initially to be integrated incrementally in the Firefox browser engine it tries to keep as much compatibility as possible with C/C++.

Rust also has a minimal runtime (like C, unlike Python), making it a good candidate for embedding into other software or even for situations where strict control of resources is required (microcontrollers and embedded systems, for example).
